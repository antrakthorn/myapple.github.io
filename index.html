            <p>All Mac computers use the macOS operating system.
                Since 2020, they use the "M" series CPUs designed by
                Apple based on ARM architecture. These chips have been
                praised for their excellent performance and power efficiency.
                Mac computers are popular with students and creative
                professionals for their elevated style and ease of use.
                Computer programmers might also use them because the underlying
                operating system is based on Unix and is POSIX compatible. Due
                to the lack of built-in central management and high cost, Mac
                computers have historically been unpopular in the workplace.
                Still, the introduction of Zero Trust, BYOD and third-party tools
                such as Jamf have begun to make them more acceptable to IT
                administrators.</p>
